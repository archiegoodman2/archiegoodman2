👋 Hi, I’m @archiegoodman2
I'm currently working as a Developer/Junior Data Scientist at a large bank, and these are my projects for personal development. These are my current projects:

  1. Basic Feed Forward Neural Network classifier to practice automatic HP tuning and visualization
  2. Autoencoder to reduce dimensionality of input data
  3. Transformer network for time series data classification (2013 European fraud dataset)
